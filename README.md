# Milestone-2--Interactive-Data-Project
REFLECTION

I am happy to share my progress on my project so far. My first milestone of gathering data did not go well, as I realized that my data sources were not reliable or credible. For my second milestone, I spent a lot of time searching for a valuable and dependable dataset, which I was ultimately able to find. However, due to the time constraints of finding a reliable data source, I was unable to properly visualize my data.

As I move forward, I am excited to analyze fully the datasets I have collected and learn how to visualize them using Plotly. I am particularly interested in creating engaging 2D or 3D plots to present my data in a comprehensive and exciting way. Although I am uncertain if I can accomplish this goal, I am committed to working towards it.

Overall, I am enthusiastic about the potential of my project and the new skills I will develop throughout the rest of the semester. I look forward to continuing my exploration of the US Tech industry, uncovering new insights and discoveries, and presenting them in innovative and engaging ways.
